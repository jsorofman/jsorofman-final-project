<h1>Healthcare Learning Management System (LMS): <br>New Information Architecture</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This healthcare learning management system (LMS) is marketed as a strategic solution to vastly improve patient outcomes in healthcare facilities. By delivering
sophisticated online assessments and training, healthcare companies can identify employee skills gaps and provide required remediation.</p>




<h2>The Design Challenge</h2>   
<p>The global navigation in the product looked like this:</p>
<img src="/images/existing_sitenav.png">


<ul>
<li>Nothing about the information architecture communicated strategic value.</li> 
<li>Links in the highest level of the left-hand navigation covered a broad range of content types, some which were content
objects and others were functionality. The purpose of those objects and their relationships to other links were unclear.</li>

<li>According to user surveys, the navigation was cluttered, confusing and didn't link to functionality that should be easily accessible. It took a lot of time to onboard new users
since none of it was intuitive.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="highlight">
<p>The navigation was a huge missed revenue opportunity. It failed to provide a content structure that
supported product and packaging strategies by highlighting new product offerings and showing end-to-end
solutions. Drawing the connection between information architecture and business goals was important when
advocating this initiative as a priority to product leadership.</p>
</aside>

<hr>

</div>


<div class="goals">

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>I defined the information architecture goals from both user and business perspectives:</p>

<section class="objectives">


<div class="objectives-list">

<ul>

<li>Create a user experience for LMS clients that integrates seamlessly into their daily workflow.</li>

<li>Provide direct and intuitive paths for users to efficiently complete the tasks they set out to do.</li>

<li>Speak to users in their language.</li>

<li>Organize information and design functionality according to their view of the world.</li>

<li>Develop a flexible, scalable framework that can easily accommodate current and future LMS product offerings.</li>

<li>Design a site structure in which new initiatives can be packaged and highlighted to clients instead of lost in the
UI.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Initial Exploration</h2>

<p>While the current site structure happened as a function of aggregating similar content types, I took a task-oriented
approach to improving it.</p>

<aside class="highlight">

    <p>"What do users want to accomplish when coming to the platform?"</p>

</aside>

<p>According to user research, the list of tasks included:</p>
<ul>

<li>Assign training</li>

<li>Create training</li>

<li>Assess skills and competencies</li>

<li>Run reports</li>

<li>Check organizational compliance</li>

<li>Manage users in the system</li>

</ul>

<hr>
</div>

<div class="initial-solution">
<h2>Initial Solution</h2>

<p>I took an initial shot at creating a sitemap that focused on the tasks listed above. It broke the top level IA out into
major task areas and spec’d out which existing content types would fall into each category, like a hybrid
sitemap/content inventory.</p>

<img src="/images/initial_sitemap.png">

<p><strong>“Users” became “People,”</strong> and the different kinds of users - administrators, learners and applicants - were delineated
separately in the next level of the IA. Administrators manage users within the system; learners are assigned training.

<p><strong>It’s also important to distinguish a job applicant being assessed for a position from a full-time employee with a more
permanent status in the system.</strong>Each user type has different tasks associated with it, and when they were lumped under
the broad category of “Users,” it was hard to find the right people in the system and the right tasks. </p>

<aside class="highlight">
<p>Because this LMS is a mission-driven product to improve healthcare outcomes for people, the use of the word “People” at the highest level
of navigation supports that brand standard and serves as a reminder that people are at the heart of this effort.</p>
</aside>

<p>“Learning” stayed the same, but <strong>the subnavigation became “Create Training” and “Assign Training,” creating a clear path
for the tasks that happen within that topic.</strong> All the content linked under this category in the previous navigation will
get rolled up in the UI and appear as tasks are being completed.</p>

<p>Diving a bit deeper, “Training” was a big, all-encompassing category that wasn’t limited to just training. There were
content objects like skills checklists and competency assessments that provided a mechanism for evaluating learners’
skills and abilities, which isn’t the same as training.</p>

<p><strong>For the purposes of this exercise, I defined “Training” as “acquiring new information,” and differentiated the skills
checklists and assessments from training as learners “demonstrating what they know.”</strong>I created a separate category for
that content to support that distinction: “Evaluations.”</p>

<p>“Reporting” was self-explanatory and remained the same.</p>

<div class="validation-1">

<h2>Validation, Round 1</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the timing around initial validation came at the start of a global pandemic, and our target users are
healthcare administrators. It wasn’t an appropriate time to reach out to them for validation. I took the sitemap to my
next best audience: Internal client success managers (CSMs). They are the bridge between our product and end users, and
they have encyclopedic knowledge of client types, use cases, and the gaps where the product falls short on usability to
the point where clients pick up the phone for help.</p>

<p>I’d grouped our existing content into task-oriented categories and I wanted unbiased feedback as to what those
categories should be. I deleted the labels of the highest level categories from their boxes on the sitemap. Instead of
asking the CSMs whether my interpretation of those categories made sense, I asked them what labels they would assign if
given the IA job. I got invaluable feedback around both the content groupings and CSM insights into what they would call
those groups. Here’s an example of that feedback from “Learning” and “Create Coursework” and “Assign Coursework.”</p>

<img src="/images/CSM_IA_Feedback.png">

<p>After revealing my initial takes on the major navigation labels, we discussed which ones we thought were most intuitive
and effective, and I incorporated the feedback into the next round of the sitemap. Below is Version 2 of the proposed
site structure, ready for another round of validation by clients.</p>

<div class="validation-2">

<h2>Validation, Round 2</h2>

<p>After the initial response to the pandemic, our clients indicated they were available again to provide feedback. I chose
a hosted card sort activity using Optimal Workshop as the most convenient and least intrusive way for them to do that. I
set up the activity and asked platform administrators across client verticals to determine where content objects fit into major navigation categories.
Surprisingly, the response was significantly higher for this activity than it had been for previous UX surveys – perhaps
the sorting activity was a welcome diversion at work?</p>

<img src="/images/optimal_sort.png">

<p>We analyzed the data from 126 completed card sorts and determined that the categories were intuitive and clear about
nearly every piece of major functionality on the platform. There was one exception where participants placed the “Hierarchies”
functionality in a 50/50 split between “People” and “Site Settings.” </p>

<p>Because Hierarchies is an important tool that
enables healthcare administrators to organize training groups and hold supervisors accountable for compliance, this
split generated an additional user research initiative to better understand how to improve the functionality and how to
define it in terms of the site IA. For the purpose of this project, the research put the functionality squarely in the
“Users” category.</p>

<div class="final-solution">

<h2>Final Solution</h2>

<p>Once the revisions were made as a result of internal CSM and client validation, I met with the director of product
management to review the product roadmap and play a game of “IA Jenga” where the goal was to determine if any
roadmap initiatives would collapse the site structure. I was pleased to report that the site structure was flexible
enough to incorporate all new product features for the next two years of development.</p>

<p>The final IA is reflected in the wireframe below. When you compare the full left hand navigation in this wireframe to
the navigation bars at the top of this case study, the impact of the redesign is clear. It provides users a direct and
unambiguous path to getting work done. It brings new product initiatives and content to the surface. It eliminates
confusion and redundancies. The streamlined nature of the navigation supports the simplicity of the new brand and visual
redesign that will be rolling out as part of this effort.</p>

<div class="key-outcomes">

<h2>Key Outcomes</h2>

<p><strong>The content I previously categorized as “Evaluations” evolved into a new content category called “Competency
Management.”</strong> While competency management was a product initiative in the works, it had not been clearly defined or
considered relative to the information architecture in the LMS. It had also been obscured as a form of “training,” so
<strong>this design process was instrumental in clearly defining a new product with significant future revenue streams.</strong></p>

<p>Information architecture in general was a new concept to this product organization, and this exercise demonstrated the
value of this approach to product design.<strong>In less than a year since I initiated this effort, the final site IA has
become the “North Star” for a holistic product redesign, as well as the foundation for a new services-based backend
architecture and the backbone of a new pricing and packaging strategy.</strong> This initiative quickly gained enterprise-wide visibility due to its 
significant impact on product strategy and direction.</p>
